# Feature Specification: Style Books Table to Occupy One-Fourth Screen

**Feature Branch**: `002-style-the-table`  
**Created**: 2025-01-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "style the table to occupy one-fourth of the screen"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature identified: Style summary table to occupy 25% of desktop screen width
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Users viewing reading data on desktop and mobile
   → Actions: Display condensed statistics in table format
   → Data: Aggregated book statistics for selected year
   → Constraints: Table must fit in 25% width on desktop, full width on mobile, one dashboard view
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Clarification received: Table should display only top-level summary numbers
   → Clarification received: Mobile should expand to full width
   → Clarification received: Design for single dashboard view with all data visible
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → User flow: View year → See condensed stats table (25% width) alongside charts (75% width)
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Table display requirements (condensed format)
   → Sizing and responsive layout requirements
   → Single-view dashboard constraint
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Books (source data)
   → Reading Statistics (aggregated data)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All clarifications resolved
   → Desktop-first design with mobile responsiveness
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a reading tracker user, I want to see my reading data displayed in a condensed summary table that occupies one-fourth of the screen width alongside a line chart visualization, so that I can quickly view key statistics and visualize my reading trends over time in a single dashboard view.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am viewing my reading tracker for 2025 on a desktop screen, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a condensed books table that takes up 25% of the screen width and displays summary statistics only (no individual book titles)
2. **Given** I have books tracked for the selected year, **When** I view the page, **Then** the table displays top-level summary numbers (e.g., total books, pages read) in a condensed format
3. **Given** I am viewing the monthly reading chart, **When** I see the visualization, **Then** it displays as a line chart showing books read per month with connected data points
4. **Given** I resize my browser window on desktop, **When** the window width changes, **Then** the table maintains its 25% width proportion
5. **Given** I am viewing the page on a mobile device, **When** the page loads, **Then** the table expands to full width for readability
6. **Given** there are no books for the selected year, **When** I view the page, **Then** the table area shows "0 books" or similar empty state

### Edge Cases
- **Narrow screens (mobile)**: Table collapses to full width on mobile devices for usability
- **Many books (>50)**: Table displays condensed summary statistics only, not individual book rows
- **Long book titles**: Not applicable - table shows only top-level summary numbers, no book titles
- **Empty months**: Line chart should show zero values with connected data points, maintaining continuity across months with no books read
- **Single data point**: Line chart should still render appropriately even if only one month has data

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a condensed summary table showing statistics for the selected year
- **FR-002**: Table MUST occupy exactly one-fourth (25%) of the screen width on desktop screens
- **FR-003**: Table MUST display only top-level summary numbers (e.g., total books, total pages, average pages) without individual book titles or authors
- **FR-004**: Table MUST be visible alongside existing charts and statistics in a single dashboard view
- **FR-005**: System MUST update table content when user selects a different year
- **FR-006**: Table MUST maintain 25% width proportion when browser window is resized on desktop
- **FR-007**: Table MUST expand to full width on mobile devices (screens narrower than typical tablet width)
- **FR-008**: Table MUST display an empty state with "0 books" or similar message when no books exist for selected year
- **FR-009**: Table MUST handle any number of books (including 50+) by displaying aggregated statistics rather than individual rows
- **FR-010**: Table content MUST fit within viewport height without requiring vertical scrolling (condensed format only)
- **FR-011**: Monthly reading chart MUST be displayed as a line chart with connected data points showing books read per month
- **FR-012**: Line chart MUST use smooth curves or straight lines to connect monthly data points
- **FR-013**: Chart MUST be responsive and occupy the remaining 75% of screen width on desktop

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Book**: Represents a finished book with attributes including title, author, finish date, page count, and publication year (data already exists in books.json)
- **Reading Statistics**: Aggregated data derived from books, including total count, total pages, average pages per book, etc.

## Clarifications Resolved

All clarifications have been provided:

1. **Dimension interpretation**: ✅ Confirmed as 25% of screen WIDTH
2. **Mobile behavior**: ✅ Table should expand to full width on mobile devices
3. **Content handling**: ✅ Table displays condensed summary statistics only (not individual book rows), so it handles any number of books
4. **Sort order**: ✅ Not applicable - table shows aggregated statistics, not sortable book list
