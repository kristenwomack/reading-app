    "My Review": "This book had so much to offer in the math, science, and art of network products, the importance of networks in the success of products, and observations of patterns in atomic networks and networks of networks. By the end of the book I could predict each time a new person was going to be introduced that it was going to be a man. I don’t think any other women were mentioned in this book except Meg Whitman, CEO of eBay. <br/><br/>The book was heavy on tech bros and bias towards Uber. I know the author worked at Uber, but I grew tired of that story weaved throughout the book. And the conclusion painted the picture that the founder of Uber was a regular founder when actually he was toxic and harmful to women in tech. <br/><br/>I had dinner with the author, Andrew, in 2015 and we had great conversation; I really liked him and wanted to like this book. But by the end it was clear that Andrew’s network is deep with tech bros and that, as he said in the conclusion that those who enjoyed the success of Uber are the next founders, advisors, and investors of the next generation of companies, which perpetuate the problem of gender inequality in tech. It is well documented now, at the time of this book being written and published, how many women were harassed, mistreated, and pushed out of Uber because of its toxic culture. This book now also cements the history as being led by men, further reinforcing the gender bias in tech we see today."
